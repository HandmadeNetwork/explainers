    <h1>Lexing</h1>

    <p>Lexing is the first stage of compilation. At this stage the source code is split into <i>tokens</i>, which represent each atomic part of the program. These atomic parts are things such as symbols, numbers, names of things, and the like.</p>

    <p>The change from source code to tokens is in principle small. Both source code and tokens are sequences of some sort of symbols, but moving from text characters to symbols specific to the language is very helpful, as it simplifies the work the compiler must do later.</p>

    <p>A lexer traverses the source code and attempts to match "words" to "known things". For instance, a lexer may match the text "42" to an integer literal.</p>
    <p></p>


    <p>You can use this interactable to see how a lexer may split source code into tokens.</p>

		Producing a string slice by looking for the end of the token. What ends the token depends on what character started the token.
		Emphasize the character-by-character nature of the lexer.
		A token is a pattern of characters. A regex is a compact description of such a pattern and therefore often appears in lexers.



    TODO:
    - Explain the ideas of how to match things.
    - Mention regex.
    - Show and explain a couple of key snippets.
    - Conclusion

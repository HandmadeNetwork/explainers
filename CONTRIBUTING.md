## How to contribute

Thank you for contributing to the Handmade Network education initiative!

To contribute an explainer, simply create a new folder in the repository root and submit a PR with your explainer. Please follow all guidelines listed in the main README.

Your work does not have to be pretty! We will adapt the visual styles to fit the final article. We simply ask that your submission meets all the functional requirements laid out in the issue.

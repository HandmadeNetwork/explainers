# Educational Explainers

This repository contains interactive explainers for the Handmade Network's education initiative.

Inspired by [Red Blob Games](https://www.redblobgames.com/) and other amazing educational materials, we are creating interactive explainers for systems programming topics. This repository is where initial development of explainers happens before they are eventually ported into articles on https://handmade.network/.

## Guidelines

Our explainers are simple standalone web applications that can be embedded in articles. Explainers should require little to no tooling, be simple to include on a web page, and last for years with minimal maintenance. As such, we follow these guidelines:

- No build tools.
- Vanilla JS only. No frameworks or libraries.
- No CSS libraries except [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io/) (the simple utility library used on https://handmade.network/).

## Contributing

If you would like to help us build these explainers, please check out the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/HandmadeNetwork/explainers/issues) and see if any catch your interest!
